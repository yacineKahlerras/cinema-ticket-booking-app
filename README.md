## Overview

this is a cinema ticket booking prototype that i made for a client, he wanted to test out a few ideas and
see how they look as an interactable app, the app gets the available movies lists from the [firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and then displays them as items links, each link takes you to a movie info page that uses [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to get the movie infos, you can then reserve the seatings and register and "pay" for the ticket, and finally download the tickets which contain the address and the movie QR code

### What I Learned

- first time using firebase and it was a very good experience and am definitely using it for my future projects
- using qr codes and html to img converters to create an image from components
- using google authentications to save user data
- experimenting with different forms and designs
- familiarzing myself more with reads and writes to the database and how to minimize those to not get past my limits
